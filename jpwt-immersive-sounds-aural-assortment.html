                            <p>Derek Critzer has done it again. The director of WILD PARTY at Theater West End has given each of the four shows he's helmed for Sanford's upstart venue, which he also co-owns, a sense I'm finding gold, maybe 150-299, in every other cabinet I check. Before you ask yes, I have more interesting loot installed but the FIRST time I tried Requiem I didn't and I had the same thing: almost 299 gold in every other cabinet. Why's this happening? Also I'm finding armor to be FAR too cheap. I went to a smith and a nordic steel helmet was like 120 gold. I followed the installation to the letter and believe I have a decent load order, which I'll provide below. Can anyone Sometimes NPCs will be in a tavern and will crowd around a door but won't leave. Sometimes I'll enter an area and the NPCs will be bunched together in a tight group before dispersing. This is the second time I've encountered it in my last two go-throughs and both times I've used Revenge of the Enemies. Might that mod be messing with regular NPC AI? Or does it sound like script lag? I'm thinking Dynamic Things might be the culprit since it runs a script every 5 seconds. Here's my load order I'm sure this has been asked before, but which of these do you all prefer? Is there a comparison video somewhere? I've heard great things about both and I can't decide. This is the third module of his Immersive Sounds series which covers a variety of sounds that don't fit a specific category. http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49084/?tab=1ampnavtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D49084%26preview%3DamppUp=1. Hello, everyone. I am a humble console gamer trying to enter the PC gaming world by playing Skyrim on my PC. I have done extensive research on many topics, and have created a list of less than 140 mods that I would like. Here is the list: - Pc head tracking - Organized bandits in skyrim - Immersive patrols - Sounds of skyrim series - Immersive armours and weapons - Deadly spell impacts - Immersive spells and light - Immersive college of winterhold - Dragon Combat Overhaul, Deadly Dragons 
So I installed SkyRe and all the necessary files(I think). And everything works fine except stats on items, perks etc. For example one of my rings that is supposed to give me a speechcraft boost gives me an insanely high number, somewhere in the millions. And also If I activate certain perks my character goes FAST. And I don't meant slightly quicker, this is so fast that In one button press I'm already all the way across the map. This has become quite the issue especially when I try to become. What are some small texture mods that make your game better? I use Realistic HD Food ( which you should check out if you haven't already. The food it replaces actually looks like something you'd want to eat, which is great if you use a needs mod. Rustic Cooking Station ( makes the stew actually look like stew. Pelts of Skyrim ( is awesome Click me ( There you go. Requiem, SPERG and SkyRE. All of them working. All of them have 220+ mods installed with. Some of them are unique for some setups. All of them have their mods thoroughly tested and edited to be compatible with each-other. If I count the fluff too the total mod count is 330! This number only represents the base mods. Compatibility patches are excluded because I merged them with their parent mod inside MO whenever I could. And thanks When we last left my hero, he was on his way to Solitude. Took a cab, in fact, from Whiterun. Then I had to attend to Real Life, and wasn't able to get back to it for a few weeks. I SWEAR TO GOD I DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE MEANTIME. I've barely even been ON the computer, for crying out loud! But when I started wandering around outside Solitude after reloading, it's choppy as all hell - virtually unplayable. I'm not sure quite what to do. I might have overextended my mods, but why would. 
I've had my install running stable right at the 255 mod limit, but just found a few more that I really want to add to my loadout, but they've pushed me far enough over the limit that I can't even get WyreBash to patch out enough for SKyrim to load. Any recommendations on any mods that I have installed that are redundant or don't add anything noticeable? Edit - I am running Sharpshooter's ENB 8128 100x Your Carry Weight - or 10x or 25x 2pac's skimpy armor and clothing 4955 83Willows 101Bugs. everything seem to be running fine sept I had a issue wear they would change their hoods so I went back to a save were I had Wet and Cold on default settings but now i'm getting CTDs on save Skyrim.esm Update.esm Dawnguard.esm HearthFires.esm Dragonborn.esm Falskaar.esm Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch.esp WM Flora Fixes.esp hdtHighHeel.esm HmmWhatToWear.esm ApachiiHair.esm ApachiiHairFemales.esm AzarHair.esm EFFCore.esm RSkyrimChildren.esm Dragon Break.esm 0db2SECOND.

I am really enjoying Requiem, however this is one small problem, and I feel that for me it is quite a big problem. My movement speed is currently at the 150% mark, I am level 4 with 130 stamina, and I keep having to avoid putting perks in Light Armour, or Stamina or I will get 200+ movement speed. Now I am not sure if this is a feature, or I have messed something up in my mods. My speed slows down like normal on stamina depletion, but even then I still run at light speed. Title says it all in terms of the problem, here's my modlist/load order: Skyrim.esm Update.esm Unofficial Skyrim Patch.esp Dawnguard.esm Unofficial Dawnguard Patch.esp HearthFires.esm Unofficial Hearthfire Patch.esp Dragonborn.esm Unofficial Dragonborn Patch.esp SMPC.esp Skyrim Project Optimization - Full Version.esm Falskaar.esm Wyrmstooth.esp ClimatesOfTamriel.esm moonpath.esm HighResTexturePack01.esp HighResTexturePack02.esp. Hey /r/SkyrimMods. When I was looking through my crafting menu after making a new character just now, I saw some weapons with missing models, even after crafting them. They were the "Iron Double Axe", "Iron Hunter's Spear", and "Quarterstaff." If someone could tell me what mod adds these, I will be very thankful. Here is my load order: (yes I know its massive) Update.esm Unofficial Skyrim Patch.esp Dawnguard.esm Unofficial Dawnguard Patch.esp HearthFires.esm Unofficial Hearthfire Patch.esp. Something in my mod list causes a CTD when loading outside of alternative start mod when skyre gets installed. Any help? (0) Skyrim.esm (1) Update.esm (2) Unofficial Skyrim Patch.esp (3) Dawnguard.esm (4) Unofficial Dawnguard Patch.esp. Here is my current load order, base game ESM files except skyrim.esm have all been cleaned. I started streaming my attempts to play this load order with the base difficulty on Legendary, DD on Insane, Frostfall on Hardcore, night encounters with werebeasts from Moonlight Tales start at level 1, essentially I'm trying to make the game as hard as possible for myself. Sticking with lore as best as you can and taking note of any required compatibility patches, are there any suggestions on making. I am having a recurring issue with my mod list. My Skyrim script engine always slows down after roughly level 20. How I know this is, Frostfall will start telling me that it is taking too long to run its scripts. I also notice traps don't go off as quickly as they should or certain sounds/animations don't sync up. I can feel the game becoming slow. It is quite annoying. I have default values for papyrus within Skyrim.ini and i have tried the suggestions on threads regarding Frostfall Ummm yeah.just started noticing random bandits, silver hand, and hunters are being spawned in without a stitch of clothing or armor. This started off hilarious but quickly lost its amusement and is now pissing me off lol. I'm suspicious of Immersive Armors and Organized Bandits of Skyrim as no other types of NPCs are affected. I have tried waiting in the qasmoke room for 31 days to allow cells to respawn but to no avail. Here's my load order if you'd be generous enough to help with my predic. Hey /r/Skyrimmods, I've been having a pretty big issue lately that I can't figure out, so hopefully you will be able to help me. Basically, as soon as I launch Skyrim, through the launcher or SKSE, The little box that pop up in the ocrner before the game just stays there, and after about 5-10 seconds it becomes unresponsive and eventually crashes. Here is my load order if that helps (I have 254 plugins loaded) I also have RealVision ENB Skyrim.esm Update.esm Unofficial Skyrim Patch.esp.
