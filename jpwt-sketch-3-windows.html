For us bois still trapped in purgatory on the waitlist. Post notification info, decisions, and anything else pertaining to this topic right here. I’ve done a little digging, and it says they activate the list starting around May 8th-10th, but the source is a little sketch. The window closes on June 30th. This year they’ve accepted 1,895 students, with an additional 902 on waitlist. They expect to have a class of 1,296 students, with a yield rate in the upper 60 percents, so it will be close. Hello everybody, I have a problem pairing my macbook pro with my arduino leonardo. Here is the error : amp#x200B; Arduino: 1.8.6 (Mac OS X), Board: "Arduino Leonardo" amp#x200B; Sketch uses 13314 bytes (46%) of program storage space. Maximum is 28672 bytes.

Ok so I have my debloat script that pretty much works, but doesnt. The code I'm using here removes all apps but whats in my whitelist except 1 app and I cannot figure it out! amp#x200B; This seems to work, but heres the odd part. Stickynotes keeps getting removed and I dont know why! Camera, calc and screensketch stay entact and I can access them fine. Stickynotes not matter what I try gets removed. regex $WhitelistedApps = 'Microsoft.ScreenSketch Microsoft.WindowsCalculator. How do I use Sketch on Windows laptop. I'm doing a project for the database of our family's small business. I'm at the beginner level of swing and I'm learning while I'm creating the database. I have to finish this before my summer ends but I want to learn and gain experience from doing this project ( this is my 2nd largest project for me ) What do you think is better? Should I use the netbeans GUI builder or should I just hardcode it? BTW I don't have any flowchart or a rough sketch on windows, I'm doing the project blind. Hi. So I want to start designing better websites and mobile applications than what I've been doing so far. After doing some research I found out that many professionals use Sketch for OS X but right now I do not have a Mac available for my use. I found about this software called Lunacy, which some blogs describe as the best alternative to Sketch on Windows. As someone who has never used a software like this before I do not know what this one lacks and what it doesn't and how relevant Hi guys, I've run into a bit of an issue trying to scale a drawing in layout. I've probably gone about it the wrong way entirely but I need to submit it for feedback by tonight so I'm unable to redraw. In short I was supplied CAD drawings of an exterior space. The brief was to redesign the area so I cleaned up the CAD lines and set about my redesign. After i was happy with the line work I exported to layout for simple block colouring and hatching etc. I had assumed that A3 would be sufficient.  
Hi guys. I just wondered if would be possible make little helpfull tool to see how many main resources you have in inventory (starship, backpack + cargo) couse its really paintfull switching between inventory screens. Its slow, fps is dropping and I hate click the inventory button all the time to make sure how many of plutonium or iron I have. Especialy when I need check cargo. There could be some tool that could make counting for you and after pressing some button it show you instantly For me, the whole .NET/Windows development cosmos seems like an even weirder world than the one that I faced when I started iOS/Mac development a few years back. So how do you get into it in the year 2016? I heard there is a thing called UWP and apparently MS wants it to be the only thing around, right? On the surface(haha) it sounds to be a nice thing to have one platform to rule all device sizes. I cannot use Sketch on Windows, so what do you use for app design? I don't First this is the error i am returned when compiling a sketch: C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\Documents\Arduino\libraries\IRremote\src\IRremoteTools.cpp:5:16: error: 'TKD2' was not declared in this scope int RECV_PIN = TKD2; // the pin the IR receiver is connected to ^ Multiple libraries were found for "IRremote.h" Used: C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\Documents\Arduino\libraries\IRremote Not used: C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\Documents\Arduino. Bran Article - NYTimes (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/arts/television/game-of-thrones-night-king-isaac-hempstead-wright.html) amp#x200B; I read this interview with the actor that plays Bran this morning and wanted to pull a Tommen and jump out the window. Great job by the reporter to ask some of the tough questions about the story. When you finish the interview, you understand how the writers failed to explain the 3ER to even the actor, riddled Bran and hence the story with narrative. Here’s how it started (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bgywe8/ive_been_stuck_in_school_detention_for_three/) Here’s the second night (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bhydt0/ive_been_stuck_in_school_detention_for_three/) And I’m just going to jump into this one. \ It was never good news when the second hatch opened. The first time it happened, Robin Phillips emerged, still looking beautiful despite being covered in sweat and (I guessed) piss. She threw a crazed Edit: Just so you know what I deal with each week. I try to get to most comments/questions but this week it's fucking nuts.

I have been messaged by several of you asking for my thoughts and comments on the press conference recently. 
https://m.imgur.com/a/PYNzngZ I've been gaming on an 2009 HP desktop since, well.2009. For the past few years I've been just playing CSGO since it's the only thing it could handle that I found fun. I've wanted a better pc however so i could stream and play more games. Finally, back in September, I got a dishwashing job (I'm 18 as a senior in high school) to save up money for my dream i7 + 1080 build. Dishwashing fucking sucks. It's overworking, ur not really respected by anyone I didn’t notice immediately, It was slow and insidious but it soon caught up with me and I became all to aware of the subtle hostility of my neighbours. I’d just moved into my dream home. Saved up for a down payment, worked my arse off and of course with a little help from the bank of mom and dad, I’d finally done it. A two story Town House in a beautiful leafy suburb. I’d taken a sabbatical from my main job which freed me up to spend more time on art commissions. That, combined with decorati. Does anyone in Idaho remember Channel 42 in the late nineties? I work at a TV studio, as an editor, and I was going through our tape archives. and found a few VHS tapes. All of them were labeled. Each label had "Channel 42" followed by the show and episode. And after watching them, I kinda wish I hadn't. I don't know why my parents let me watch this. Maybe they didn't even know what was happening. I decided to come here. Maybe some of you will remember this channel. Here's a rough description. Hello, I was a graffiti artist at RPI from 201X-2018. I don't think any of my work is still up; it's been a while since I was on-campus. Maybe "Globe's Edge" is still there? Oh yeah, if anyone has a picture of "Globe's Edge" can they post it? I forgot to take one. Anyway, recent events got me thinking about RPI again. This post is me reflecting on my time doing graffiti here at RPI and recounting my process. I'm not an authority on the subject, but from what I can tell my work was moderately. About two weeks ago, I posted a silly response to a post on r/WritingPrompts . It went over really well to say the least. I've continued with it, fluffed up the first round, and I just finished the second chapter. I was sent in this direction for a place to post it, so here we go. amp#x200B; \ WP\ You're happily going about your day when you vanish in a cloud of smoke. Suddenly, you're standing in a ring of candles. A sorcerer holding a tome looks pleased with your arrival. Turns Most people know the story of Captain “Sully” Sullenberger, who ditched US Airways flight 1549 in the middle of New York’s Hudson River after birds destroyed both engines, saving the lives of everyone on board. Also well-known is the story of flight attendant Vesna Vulovic, who survived a mid-air bombing at 33,000 feet and went on to become a Serbian folk hero. These are remarkable tales of survival against the odds that stick with us through the decades—those moments when everyone lived I’ve been an orphan all my life or at least until I was old enough to understand what that meant. My caretaker told me she found me crying on the orphanage’s doorstep with my baby clothes as my only belongings. No other soul was in the vicinity. With that, I grew up as somewhat a quiet and distant child in which most adoptees find unappealing. Well, could you blame me? It was hard to live a life knowing the moment you were born you were unwanted. Trust has constantly been something tough So far I've been to RELM in Burlington and it was really weird. There was a security guard at the door who checks your ID like a bouncer, then you go in and the windows are all blacked out and there's literally nothing in the store except a counter and about 1600 sq ft of empty floor space. It'd be really nice if we could have stores that AREN'T like dispensaries and are more like normal head shops or the LCBO. It's not illegal anymore, I just want to be able to feel like a regular person buying.
